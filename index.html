            <h2>Beauty of Nature : Trees</h2>
    
            
           <P> Since the beginning, trees have furnished us with two of life’s essentials, food and oxygen.As we evolved, they provided additional 
            necessities such as shelter, medicine, and tools. Today, their value continues to increase and more benefits of trees are being
            discovered as their role expands to satisfy the needs created by our modern life style.
            Trees are an important part of every community. Our streets, parks, playgrounds and backyards are lined with trees that create a 
            peaceful, aesthetically pleasing environment. Trees increase our quality of life by bringing natural elements and wildlife habitats 
            into urban settings. We gather under the cool shade they provide during outdoor activities with family and friends. Many 
            neighborhoods are also the home of very old trees that serve as historic landmarks and a great source of town pride.</P></section>

                <h2>Beauty of Nature : Rivers</h2>
                <p>A river is a natural flowing freshwater stream, flowing on land or inside caves towards another body of water at a lower elevation, such as an ocean, lake, or another river. A river may run dry before reaching the end of its course if it runs out of water, or only flow during certain seasons. Rivers are regulated by the water cycle, the processes by which water moves around the Earth. Water first enters rivers through precipitation, whether that be from the runoff of water down a slope, the melting of glaciers or snow, or seepage from aquifers beneath the surface of the Earth..</p>
